## Code Review
* **Jesper Lundqvist** 

- It would had been fun with different article texts. You could have created 10 different article texts that you loop over.
- master.css:9 - The class name is misspelled.
- master.css:65-73 - Duplication of code. You could have merged them by putting a comma between the different classes so you donâ€™t have to write the code twice.
- You could have added lazy loading to the images.
- The images lacks alt attributes.
